# Daniel Quadros

Frontend Engineer with **4+ years of professional experience** building scalable, high-performance web applications using **React, Next.js, and TypeScript**.

I work on production-ready applications for real-world use, collaborating closely with **Product, UX/UI, and Backend teams**. My day-to-day involves frontend architecture decisions, defining technical standards, improving code quality, and delivering features that balance usability, performance, and maintainability.

My core experience is centered around **React and Next.js**, with a strong focus on component-driven architecture, state management, API integrations, authentication flows, and performance optimization, always applying solid software engineering practices.
